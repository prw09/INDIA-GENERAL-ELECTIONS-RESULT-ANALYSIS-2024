# **India Elections 2024 - SQL Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project offers an in-depth analysis of the **India Elections 2024** using SQL queries. The analysis spans multiple aspects of the election data, focusing on constituency-level and state-level results, party performance, and voting trends. Through a series of optimized SQL queries, the project provides a detailed breakdown of **seats won**, **party alliances**, **candidate performances**, and **vote distribution** (EVM and postal).

The data and queries help identify winning trends and offer insights into how major political alliances like **NDA** and **I.N.D.I.A** fared across states.

## **Key Features & Analysis**
- **Nationwide & Statewide Seat Analysis**:  
  - Determine the **total number of seats** contested in India and within each state.
  - Identify the **state-wise seat distribution** for political alliances.

- **Alliance Performance Insights**:  
  - Measure the **seat wins** for major alliances like **NDA** and **I.N.D.I.A**.
  - Identify which alliance **won the most seats** across all states and constituencies.

- **Candidate Performance & Vote Margins**:  
  - Analyze the **winning candidate**, their **party affiliation**, and the **margin of victory** in a given state and constituency.
  - Identify the **top-performing candidates** based on **EVM votes** and **postal votes**.

- **EVM vs Postal Voting Patterns**:  
  - Breakdown of **EVM and postal votes** for candidates within a constituency.
  - Explore the **voting trends** to understand differences in candidate support through EVM and postal votes.

## **Project Structure**
The analysis is built upon multiple SQL queries that examine key areas of election data:

1. **Constituency-wise Results**: Information on winning candidates, parties, and vote counts.
2. **State-wise Results**: Aggregated results for each state, showing the total seats won by parties.
3. **Party-wise Results**: Breakdown of the performance of each political party, including total seats won and vote shares.
4. **States Table**: Contains metadata about Indian states for easy linking to election results.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Database Management System**: MySQL
- **Concepts Utilized**:
  - SQL **JOINs** for linking multiple tables.
  - **Aggregation Functions** like `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `MAX`.
  - **Window Functions** and **Subqueries** to rank candidates and calculate vote margins.
  - **String Functions** for data cleaning and transformation.
  - **Conditional Logic** to classify party alliances as **NDA**, **I.N.D.I.A**, and **OTHER**.
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench or any SQL Client (e.g., DBeaver, HeidiSQL).

  SQL queries to calculate the total seats in India and state-wise seat allocation for the 2024 elections.
  
- **Alliance Seat Wins**:  
  Queries that aggregate the seats won by alliances **NDA**, **I.N.D.I.A**, and **OTHER** in each state and nationwide.

- **Top Candidates**:  
  Identify the candidates who received the highest number of **EVM votes** and **postal votes**.

- **Vote Distribution**:  
  Breakdown of votes cast through **EVM** and **postal ballots** in a specific constituency, allowing a detailed analysis of voting behavior.

- **Winning Margin & Runner-Up**:  
  Fetch the **winner** and **runner-up** from each constituency, along with their vote margins.
